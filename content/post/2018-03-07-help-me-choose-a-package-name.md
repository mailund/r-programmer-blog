I have plans for re-implementing several of the data structures I wrote about in [Functional Data Structures in R](http://amzn.to/2tjaWAG). I want a package with useful data structures, and I did write one, named `ralgo`, when I wrote the data structure book, but many of the data structures can be implemented much cleaner if I use the pattern matching features of [`pmatch`](https://github.com/mailund/pmatch) and, where possible, optimise the code using [`tailr`](https://github.com/mailund/tailr).

I need a good name for such a package, though. I made a GitHub repository named `pmtypes`—for “pattern matching types”—but that is a boring name.

Please help me come up with a good name.
