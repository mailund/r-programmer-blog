Ok, if this is working, it should now be possible to comment on posts here.

I was a bit slow in trying this out, because I had a hellish time setting up the blog in the first place, and I expected adding comments support with [Disqus](https://disqus.com) would be just as hard, but if this is working, it was a simple matter of adding

```
disqusShortname = "r-programmer-blog"
```

to the configuration file and telling Disqus about the existence of the blog.

Cool.
