As I wrote about [here](https://mailund.github.io/r-programmer-blog/2018/03/09/problems-with-higher-order-functions-in-tailr/) and [here](https://mailund.github.io/r-programmer-blog/2018/03/11/linked-lists-in-matchbox/), I had a problem in [`tailr`](https://github.com/mailund/tailr) with higher-order functions. In the transformation for tail-recursion optimisation, I need to know which actual functions each name refer to, in order to apply user-defined transformations, but with higher-order functions, those are not known until runtime. 

I've made a new release of `tailr`, v0.1.1, that fixes this. It accepts functions that are local variables, but cannot, of course, apply user-defined transformations for those.
