The issue with byte-compilation [I wrote about yesterday](https://mailund.github.io/r-programmer-blog/2018/03/17/building-a-package-that-uses-pattern-matching/) can indeed be fixed by transforming functions that call `cases`. And that was very easy to implement since I already had all the bits and pieces I needed for it from the `tailr` transformations.

To remind you, the issue was with byte-compiling functions that use the `pmatch` DSL in a `cases` call. For example, this function that tests if a tree is a leaf:

```{r}
library(pmatch)

tree := L(num) | T(left : tree, right : tree)

is_leaf <- function(tree) {
    cases(tree,
          L(x) -> TRUE,
          otherwise -> FALSE)
}
```

The function works as intended so in usual code you will not run into any issues with it.

```{r}
is_leaf(L(1))
is_leaf(T(L(1),L(2)))
```

If you use it in a package, though, it will (by default) be byte-compiled, and the byte-compiler does *not* approve of assigning to `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

```{r, error=TRUE}
compiler::cmpfun(is_leaf)
```

There is a similar issue if you want to throw errors with `stop`. This works fine

```{r}
get_left <- function(tree) {
    cases(
        tree,
        T(left, right) -> left,
        otherwise -> 
            stop("There is no left tree!", call. = FALSE)
    )
}
```

```{r, error=TRUE}
get_left(T(L(1),L(2)))
get_left(L(1))
```

but the byte-compiler will complain

```{r, error=TRUE}
compiler::cmpfun(get_left)
```

## Transforming functions

We can get rid of this problem by transforming the functions that call `cases`. I already do this when I combine `cases` with `tailr` to make functions tail-recursive, so I already had this function:

```{r}
transform_cases_call <- function(expr) {
    stopifnot(rlang::call_name(expr) == "cases")

    args <- rlang::call_args(expr)
    value <- args[[1]]
    patterns <- args[-1]
    eval(rlang::expr(cases_expr(!!value, !!!patterns)))
}
```

It takes a `call` object—the representation of a function-call when you manipulate R expressions—and returns a series of `if`-`else`-expressions, computed by the `cases_expr` function.

So far, I have only used this with `tailr` and its user-transformation plugin

```r
attr(cases, "tailr_transform") <- transform_cases_call
```

but now I use it for this transformation function:

```{r}
transform_cases_function_rec <- function(expr) {
    if (rlang::is_atomic(expr) || rlang::is_pairlist(expr) ||
        rlang::is_symbol(expr) || rlang::is_primitive(expr)) {
        expr
    } else {
        stopifnot(rlang::is_lang(expr))
        call_args <- rlang::call_args(expr)
        for (i in seq_along(call_args)) {
            expr[[i + 1]] <- transform_cases_function_rec(call_args[[i]])
        }
        if (rlang::call_name(expr) == "cases") {
            expr <- transform_cases_call(expr)
        }
        expr
    }
}

transform_cases_function <- function(fun) {
    if (!rlang::is_closure(fun)) {
        err <- simpleError("Function must be a closure to be transformed")
        stop(err)
    }
    body(fun) <- transform_cases_function_rec(body(fun))
    fun
}
```

The way I test if a call to `cases` is actually a call to `pmatch::cases` is a bit dodgy. It only works if the `cases` that is in scope is the right one. To fix this, I have to carry the environment along in the recursions, but I [haven't implemented this yet](https://github.com/mailund/pmatch/issues/27).

Anyway, using this function, you can automatically rewrite a function from using calls to `cases` to using `if`-statements.

```{r}
is_leaf_tr <- transform_cases_function(is_leaf)
is_leaf_tr
```

## Results

After we have translated a function, there is no more alternative DSL syntax, and that satisfy the byte-compiler.

```{r}
is_leaf_tr_bc <- compiler::cmpfun(is_leaf_tr)
```

As an added benefit, the transformed function is a bit faster than the one that calls `cases`, and the byte-compiled function is a little faster still.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
    is_leaf(L(1)), is_leaf_tr(L(1)), is_leaf_tr_bc(L(1))
)
```

(Because of my issues with Hugo and blogdown, the plot is from a different run than the output from the benchmark command so they differ a bit. Qualitatively they show the same, though).

Of course, with transformations it just becomes more important that I solve the [issue with CMD CHECK and transformed functions,](https://github.com/mailund/matchbox/issues/9) but I have no idea how to approach that yet.
