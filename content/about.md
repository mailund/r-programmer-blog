Hi, I'm Thomas Mailund, and on this blog, I write about R programming. I have a more general-purpose blog on [www.mailund.dk](http://www.mailund.dk), but since I got fed up with jumping through hoops to get R code and output displayed the way I want it, I have moved all R topics here, where I can use [`knitr`](https://yihui.name/knitr/) and [Markdown + Pandoc](http://amzn.to/2oEiBov) to create posts.

The topic for the blog is R *programming*, that is, the topics of my posts will be on how to use the [R programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) to develop new software. I might, from time to time, stumble into topics closer to statistics and how to use R as a statistical domain-specific language, but the main goal is to write about R as a general-purpose language and how you can write interesting programs using it.

I have experimented with software development in R for many years, and [written about it in several books](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mailund07-20&keywords=Thomas mailund R&index=aps&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=xm2&linkId=791a4f9ed661783ef9453051cf62104a), and have more planned. Often, though, I find myself thinking of a great topic for another chapter after the book is already in print, and now I have this blog to write about such topics. In addition, of course, it is a place to describe ideas *before* I put them in books, and maybe get some feedback from that.

I haven't figured out how to add comments to the blog yet. I'm an experience R programmer, but web-technology is magic too dark for me. I'm told [Disqus](https://disqus.com) is one way to do it, but that will be a problem for another day. If you want to reach me, you can use Twitter `@ThomasMailund` or send me an email at `thomas@mailund.dk`.
