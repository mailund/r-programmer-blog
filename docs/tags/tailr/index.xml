      <description>I have just released version 0.1.0 of foolbox and version 0.1.2 of tailr. I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually done much on the packages the last three weeks, and they have been very close to these releases for a while, but now I had the spare time and energy to actually send them off.</description>

      <description>As I wrote about here and here, I had a problem in tailr with higher-order functions. In the transformation for tail-recursion optimisation, I need to know which actual functions each name refer to, in order to apply user-defined transformations, but with higher-order functions, those are not known until runtime.</description>

      <description>I have started playing with data structures in matchbox and the first structure I implement had to be linked lists. That is the most versatile data structure I use and it is missing from R.</description>

      <description>Ok, there is a problem with higher-order functions in my tailr package that I ran into while writing linked list functions for my matchbox package.1
If you write a tail-recursive function that uses a parameter-function, the tailr package will complain that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t see that function in scope.</description>

      <description>Believe it or not, all the bother with setting up this blog was such that I could write this post easier than I could on Wordpress. So now, let us get to some actual R programming!</description>
