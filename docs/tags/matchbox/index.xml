      <description>After a week spend programming string algorithms in C—for teaching purposes, I am not working on a new read-mapper—it is nice to get back to programming in R. I made a new release of tailr today, so that is good, but what I really wanted to work on was matchbox.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on implementing red-black search trees in matchbox and have managed most of it by now. I still need to implement deletion and the re-balancing code for handling those, but I have insertion up and running.</description>

      <description>I have started playing with data structures in matchbox and the first structure I implement had to be linked lists. That is the most versatile data structure I use and it is missing from R.</description>

      <description>Ok, first, the package I wrote about yesterday will be called matchbox, following Dmytro Perepolkin&amp;rsquo;s suggestion (thanks!). You can get it at GitHub.
There isn&amp;rsquo;t much to it yet since I haven&amp;rsquo;t really started implementing the data structures I want to put in it.</description>
