      <description>As I wrote about here and here, I had a problem in tailr with higher-order functions. In the transformation for tail-recursion optimisation, I need to know which actual functions each name refer to, in order to apply user-defined transformations, but with higher-order functions, those are not known until runtime.</description>

      <description>Ok, there is a problem with higher-order functions in my tailr package that I ran into while writing linked list functions for my matchbox package.1
If you write a tail-recursive function that uses a parameter-function, the tailr package will complain that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t see that function in scope.</description>

      <description>I just added a new feature to my pmatch package. You will need the development version to get it, until I make a new release, and I have a few more features planned before that.</description>

      <description>In the approach to evaluating dynamic-programming expressions, that I wrote about yesterday, I used ranges- and recursion-specifications to build a loop for updating a table and then evaluated that loop inside an environment where local variables would over-scope the quosure environment from the specifications.</description>

      <description>I think I now have a complete implementation of the dynamic programming DSL I wrote about the other day. You can install it from the GitHub repository if you want to experiment with it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on an example for one of the chapters of Domain Specific Languages in R that will appear in the printed version but weren&amp;rsquo;t included in the earlier e-book. The plan is to have one to three extra example chapters, depending on how much I can do before my deadline on April 1st.</description>

      <description>Believe it or not, all the bother with setting up this blog was such that I could write this post easier than I could on Wordpress. So now, let us get to some actual R programming!</description>
