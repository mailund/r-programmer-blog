      <description>I wanted to write something about function parameters, how these are passed as so-called &amp;ldquo;promises&amp;rdquo;, how these have associated scopes (and the consequences of that), and how they give us lazy evaluation.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on implementing red-black search trees in matchbox and have managed most of it by now. I still need to implement deletion and the re-balancing code for handling those, but I have insertion up and running.</description>

      <description>I have started playing with data structures in matchbox and the first structure I implement had to be linked lists. That is the most versatile data structure I use and it is missing from R.</description>

      <description>Ok, first, the package I wrote about yesterday will be called matchbox, following Dmytro Perepolkin&amp;rsquo;s suggestion (thanks!). You can get it at GitHub.
There isn&amp;rsquo;t much to it yet since I haven&amp;rsquo;t really started implementing the data structures I want to put in it.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet â€” William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet
 I have plans for re-implementing several of the data structures I wrote about in Functional Data Structures in R.</description>
