      <description>Some programming languages, e.g. Swift, have special &amp;ldquo;optional&amp;rdquo; types. These are types the represent elements that either contain a value of some other type or contain nothing at all. It is a way of computing with the possibility that some operations cannot be done and then propagating that along in the computations.</description>

      <title>pmatch 0.1.3</title>

      <description>I have just released version 0.1.3 of pmatch to CRAN. There are not a lot of changes to this version compared to 0.1.2, but enough that I felt it would be good to get a version out before I pull the entire package apart to make it dependent on toolbox for its transformation function.</description>

      <description>After a week spend programming string algorithms in C—for teaching purposes, I am not working on a new read-mapper—it is nice to get back to programming in R. I made a new release of tailr today, so that is good, but what I really wanted to work on was matchbox.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on implementing red-black search trees in matchbox and have managed most of it by now. I still need to implement deletion and the re-balancing code for handling those, but I have insertion up and running.</description>

      <description>I have started playing with data structures in matchbox and the first structure I implement had to be linked lists. That is the most versatile data structure I use and it is missing from R.</description>

      <description>Ok, first, the package I wrote about yesterday will be called matchbox, following Dmytro Perepolkin&amp;rsquo;s suggestion (thanks!). You can get it at GitHub.
There isn&amp;rsquo;t much to it yet since I haven&amp;rsquo;t really started implementing the data structures I want to put in it.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet — William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet
 I have plans for re-implementing several of the data structures I wrote about in Functional Data Structures in R.</description>

      <description>I just added a new feature to my pmatch package. You will need the development version to get it, until I make a new release, and I have a few more features planned before that.</description>
