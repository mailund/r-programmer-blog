      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on implementing red-black search trees in matchbox and have managed most of it by now. I still need to implement deletion and the re-balancing code for handling those, but I have insertion up and running.</description>

      <description>I have started playing with data structures in matchbox and the first structure I implement had to be linked lists. That is the most versatile data structure I use and it is missing from R.</description>

      <title>Problems With Higher Order Functions in tailr</title>

      <description>Ok, there is a problem with higher-order functions in my tailr package that I ran into while writing linked list functions for my matchbox package.1
If you write a tail-recursive function that uses a parameter-function, the tailr package will complain that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t see that function in scope.</description>

      <description>Ok, first, the package I wrote about yesterday will be called matchbox, following Dmytro Perepolkin&amp;rsquo;s suggestion (thanks!). You can get it at GitHub.
There isn&amp;rsquo;t much to it yet since I haven&amp;rsquo;t really started implementing the data structures I want to put in it.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet — William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet
 I have plans for re-implementing several of the data structures I wrote about in Functional Data Structures in R.</description>

      <description>I just added a new feature to my pmatch package. You will need the development version to get it, until I make a new release, and I have a few more features planned before that.</description>

      <title>Another approach to evaluating dynprog expressions</title>

      <description>In the approach to evaluating dynamic-programming expressions, that I wrote about yesterday, I used ranges- and recursion-specifications to build a loop for updating a table and then evaluated that loop inside an environment where local variables would over-scope the quosure environment from the specifications.</description>

      <description>Ok, if this is working, it should now be possible to comment on posts here.
I was a bit slow in trying this out, because I had a hellish time setting up the blog in the first place, and I expected adding comments support with Disqus would be just as hard, but if this is working, it was a simple matter of adding</description>

      <description>I think I now have a complete implementation of the dynamic programming DSL I wrote about the other day. You can install it from the GitHub repository if you want to experiment with it.</description>

      <description>For the tailr post I needed to plot some benchmark results. I still haven&amp;rsquo;t figure out how I can get plots from RMarkdown automatically moved to the right directory here, but that’s okay.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m working on an example for one of the chapters of Domain Specific Languages in R that will appear in the printed version but weren&amp;rsquo;t included in the earlier e-book. The plan is to have one to three extra example chapters, depending on how much I can do before my deadline on April 1st.</description>

      <description>Believe it or not, all the bother with setting up this blog was such that I could write this post easier than I could on Wordpress. So now, let us get to some actual R programming!</description>

      <description>Ok, I hadn&amp;rsquo;t planned to write any more about how the blog is set up, since that isn&amp;rsquo;t that interesting to me and probably isn&amp;rsquo;t to you — either you know a lot more about this than me, in which case I have nothing to teach you, or you just don&amp;rsquo;t care, which I can relate to.</description>

      <description>Since I already have a blog, you might be asking, &amp;ldquo;why another one?&amp;rdquo;.
It&amp;rsquo;s a fair question, and I am not creating a new blog just to make you follow two instead of one.</description>

      <description>This is my first attempt at a Hugo+Blogdown blog. I got tired of struggling with formatting R code on my Wordpress blog, so figured it would make sense to use RMarkdown to write about R code.</description>
